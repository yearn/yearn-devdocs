## My dYFI rewards from locking aren't increasing

</summary>

The dYFI rewards that are earned from locking YFI to veYFI are not streamed linearly but instead can come in chunks. This is because veYFI earns from unclaimed dYFI from users who don't have full boost, so it is earned after gauge dYFI is distributed.

## Can I lock my veYFI so it always stays max-locked?

</summary>

If you want your veYFI to remain max-locked, you can "overLock" it, up to 10 years. This will keep your YFI at max boost and earning power until it drops below the 4 year mark. You can always set the lock time back to 4 years in the UI. Here is how you do it:

click on the gear icon in the top right hand corner.

You can then lock up to 520 weeks (10 years).

If you want to adjust this lock time, you can lower the length of the lock down to any value above 207 weeks.

- Any lock can be extended to be longer
- only locks over 208 weeks, can be reduced, and only to 208 weeks.
