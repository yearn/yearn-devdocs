# Yearn DAO

Yearn is a collective of developers, users, thinkers, and doers all working toward making the best suite of on-chain, decentralized, yield products. There are no bosses or interns, no board of directors or HR department, only those who contribute to, participate in, and explore Yearn. Yearn started as an experiment with a week long release of YFI and continues as an experiment today.

## Governance

The Yearn ecosystem is controlled by YFI token holders who submit and vote on off-chain proposals that govern the ecosystem. Proposals that generate majority support \(&gt;50% of the vote\) are implemented by a 9-member multi-signature wallet. Changes must be signed by 6 out of the 9 wallet signers to be implemented. The members of the multi-signature wallet were voted in by YFI holders and are subject to change from future governance votes. Please refer to the [multisig documentation](/developers/security/multisig) for the list of multisig signers. For more info about the governance process, please consult the [Governance FAQ](/resources/faq#governance) and [YIP-61: Governance 2.0](https://gov.yearn.fi/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460).
