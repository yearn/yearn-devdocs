For developers, check out our [list of open Github issues here](https://contribute.yearn.rocks/).

### File a Bug

If a Yearn product isn't working, please visit the appropriate Github repository listed under [General Resources](#general-resources) â€” or search in the [Yearn Github Repositories](https://github.com/yearn/) â€” to see if the issue already exists.

If it does not exist, please create a new issue following the template present in the repository.

If no issue template is present, please include information such as your browser version, device, etc. for that project so the developers can replicate it and fix it.

If the issue already exists, you can signal your support by adding a thumbs up to the existing issue or by adding helpful information.

### Leave Feedback

Use the [Feedback](https://gov.yearn.finance/c/feedback/2) section of the governance forum to provide feedback.

### Write Documentation

The Yearn ecosystem is expanding and, as a result, so is the need for documentation. You can find the "official" Yearn Documentation [here](https://docs.yearn.finance/) â€” which provides high-level overviews _and_ technical documentation.

Whether its writing _How To_ guides on using vaults or creating diagrams on how the protocol ties together, there is something for everyone. If you speak another language, translations might be up your alley!

You can see our progress on the [Github Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/yearn/projects/2) where you can look through any issue that interests you. Before contributing: Please see our [How to Use Github](https://hackmd.io/4U35op0ORoGT24lzPhbGNQ) guide and ensure that your PRs adhere to our [Writing Style Guide](https://hackmd.io/dXQecpkJQX6XRy4y7k7j3g).

We use a combination of HackMD, Docusaurus, and Github for our [Documentation](https://docs.yearn.finance/) and we use [DrawIO](https://draw.io) with Google Drive for our diagrams & schemas. If you are a grammar stickler, you can see our [Reviewer Guide](https://hackmd.io/juTKNn3xTpKJgFDo2AglLw).

Last, but not least, join the #documentation channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/freT6YRNSX) and introduce yourself.

If this sounds confusing, please let us know what we can clear up. In the meantime: You can begin contributing to our HackMD docs immediately via the Github issues â€” we'll guide you through the rest.
