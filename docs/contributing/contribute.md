## How to Contribute

### Have an idea?

We are always open to new suggestions or better ways of doing things. If you have an idea feel free to use the appropriate channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yearnfi), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/yearn_finance/), make a post on the governance [forum](https://gov.yearn.fi/c/general-chat/7), or consider adding to the [Pool of Ideas](https://yearnfinance.notion.site/Pool-of-Ideas-d75383ade9154d8bb6163388c6c2b39b). If the idea is thorough enough, make a post in the [Proposals](https://gov.yearn.fi/c/proposals/5) section on the governance forum. Be sure to follow the Proposal [Guidelines](https://gov.yearn.fi/t/proposal-how-to/106) and check previous [YIPs](https://yips.yearn.fi/all-yip) for guidance.

### Ready to contribute?

Check out our [list of open Github issues here](https://contribute.yearn.rocks/).

### File a Bug

If a Yearn product isn't working, please visit the appropriate Github repository listed under [General Resources](#general-resources) — or search in the [Yearn Github Repositories](https://github.com/yearn/) — to see if the issue already exists.

If it does not exist, please create a new issue following the template present in the repository.

If no issue template is present, please include information such as your browser version, device, etc. for that project so the developers can replicate it and fix it.

If the issue already exists, you can signal your support by adding a thumbs up to the existing issue or by adding helpful information.

### Leave Feedback

Use the [Feedback](https://gov.yearn.fi/c/feedback/2) section of the governance forum to provide feedback.

### Write Documentation

The Yearn ecosystem is expanding and, as a result, so is the need for documentation. You can find the "official" Yearn Documentation [here](https://docs.yearn.fi/) — which provides high-level overviews _and_ technical documentation.

Whether it's writing _How To_ guides on using vaults or creating diagrams on how the protocol ties together, there is something for everyone. If you speak another language, translations might be up your alley!

You can see our progress on the [Github Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/yearn/projects/2) where you can look through any issue that interests you. Before contributing: Please see our [How to Use Github](https://hackmd.io/4U35op0ORoGT24lzPhbGNQ) guide and ensure that your PRs adhere to our [Writing Style Guide](https://hackmd.io/dXQecpkJQX6XRy4y7k7j3g).

We use a combination of HackMD, Docusaurus, and Github for our [Documentation](https://docs.yearn.fi/) and we use [DrawIO](https://draw.io) with Google Drive for our diagrams & schemas. If you are a grammar stickler, you can see our [Reviewer Guide](https://hackmd.io/juTKNn3xTpKJgFDo2AglLw).

Last but not least, join the #documentation channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/freT6YRNSX) and introduce yourself.

If this sounds confusing, please let us know what we can clear up. In the meantime: You can begin contributing to our HackMD docs immediately via the Github issues — we'll guide you through the rest.

### Build

#### Developers

If you're a developer, we need your help! Before you begin: Familiarize yourself with Yearn, its products, and its infrastructure by reading our [Documentation](https://docs.yearn.fi/).

You can see our progress on our [Github Project Board](https://contribute.yearn.farm/good-first-issue.html), and you can immediately begin contributing where you see fit. We recommend checking out issues tagged as `help wanted` and recommend sticking to the respective repository's coding guidelines (linting, formatting, PRs, etc). It's that simple 🙂. You can also join us on the #dev channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/w89vVxeV9h).

If you are interested in working on a specific project, check out the list of Yearn products in the [General Resources](#general-resources) section below or check out our list of repos [here](https://github.com/orgs/yearn/repositories).

If you want an overview of how our vaults work, please see the schema and accompanying descriptions in the [Vaults Overview](https://docs.yearn.fi/getting-started/products/yvaults/overview).

If you're wondering how **strategies** work, please check out [Yearn Vaults v2 Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0fsYiCI54g) — hosted by our Yearn Devs. To start writing your own strategy, please check out our template [Yearn Brownie Mix](https://github.com/yearn/brownie-strategy-mix).

#### Designers

We invite designers, animators, artists, and more to share your skills with the Yearn ecosystem!

#### Creating Strategies

##### Workshop

The best introduction to V2 is the workshop done for Gitcoin Kernel Sessions. Even its focused on security, it's a great introduction to Vaults V2.
