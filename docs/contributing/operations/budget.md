# Budget

Yearn works with project-based budget requests, which focus on transparency and accountability. This system is in constant evolution, feedbacks are welcome!

Budget requests are approved by the yBudget team and require a 3/5 consensus

The team recommendations to make requests are:

- When coordinating efforts with more people, apply a team (not as separate individuals)
- Shorter timeframes of 1 to 3 months may have better rates of approval

All Yearn payments streams can be visualized at our [LlamaPay Streams Dashboard](https://llamapay.io/streams?chainId=1&address=ychad.eth)
