# Budget Request Process

Yearn works with project-based grants (aka budget requests), which focus on transparency and accountability. This system is in constant evolution so feedback is welcome!

Budget requests are reviewed and voted upon by all other yTeams with existing grants. 7 teams vote and are chosen at random based on multiple factors, including the amount of revenue they earn for Yearn. To pass, budget requests require 4 of the 7 voting teams to vote "yes".

General recommendations when making budget requests are:

- When coordinating efforts with others, apply as a team (not as separate individuals)
- There is a 3 month budget request cadence so your request should cover that period or less.
