# Budget Process

:::warning

This is not the current process. needs updating to reflect current and future plans.

:::

Yearn works with project-based budget requests, which focus on transparency and accountability. This system is in constant evolution, feedbacks are welcome!

Budget requests are approved by the yBudget team and require a 3/5 consensus

The team recommendations to make requests are:

- When coordinating efforts with others, apply as a team (not as separate individuals)
- Shorter timeframes of 1 to 3 months may have better rates of approval
