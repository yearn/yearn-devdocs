# Deprecated Smart Contracts

:::info

These are Yearn legacy contracts. Vaults may not be updated after being deployed so live yVaults may use these contracts. If you are creating new yVaults, we highly recommend using the most recent version of the contracts.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
