# Vault.vy


**Yearn Token Vault**





*Yearn Token Vault. Holds an underlying token, and allows users to interact with the Yearn ecosystem through Strategies connected to the Vault. Vaults are not limited to a single Strategy, they can have as many Strategies as can be designed (however the withdrawal queue is capped at 20.) Deposited funds are moved into the most impactful strategy that has not already reached its limit for assets under management, regardless of which Strategy a user's funds end up in, they receive their portion of yields generated across all Strategies. When a user withdraws, if there are no funds sitting undeployed in the Vault, the Vault withdraws funds from Strategies in the order of least impact. (Funds are taken from the Strategy that will disturb everyone's gains the least, then the next least, etc.) In order to achieve this, the withdrawal queue's order must be properly set and managed by the community (through governance). Vault Strategies are parameterized to pursue the highest risk-adjusted yield. There is an "Emergency Shutdown" mode. When the Vault is put into emergency shutdown, assets will be recalled from the Strategies as quickly as is practical (given on-chain conditions), minimizing loss. Deposits are halted, new Strategies may not be added, and each Strategy exits with the minimum possible damage to position, while opening up deposits to be withdrawn by users. There are no restrictions on withdrawals above what is expected under Normal Operation.

## Functions



### initialize
```solidity
function initialize(address,address,address,string,string)
```


Initializes the Vault, this is called only once, when the contract is deployed. The performance fee is set to 10% of yield, per Strategy. The management fee is set to 2%, per year. The initial deposit limit is set to 0 (deposits disabled); it must be updated after initialization.

### setWithdrawalQueue
```solidity
function setWithdrawalQueue(address[20])
```


Updates the withdrawalQueue to match the addresses and order specified by `queue`. There can be fewer strategies than the maximum, as well as fewer than the total number of strategies active in the vault. `withdrawalQueue` will be updated in a gas-efficient manner, assuming the input is well- ordered with 0x0 only at the end. This may only be called by governance or management.    


*This is order sensitive, specify the addresses in the order in which funds should be withdrawn (so `queue`[0] is the first Strategy withdrawn from, `queue`[1] is the second, etc.) This means that the least impactful Strategy (the Strategy that will have its core positions impacted the least by having funds removed) should be at `queue`[0], then the next least impactful at `queue`[1], and so on.*

| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  * True if transfer is sent to an address other than this contract's or 0x0, otherwise the transaction will fail. * |






### transferFrom
```solidity
function transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
```


Transfers `amount` shares from `sender` to `receiver`. This operation will always return true, unless the user is attempting to transfer shares to this contract&#39;s address, or to 0x0.

### deposit
```solidity
function deposit()
```


Deposits `_amount` `token`, issuing shares to `recipient`. If the Vault is in Emergency Shutdown, deposits will not be accepted and this call will fail.    


*Measuring quantity of shares to issues is based on the total outstanding debt that this contract has (&#34;expected value&#34;) instead of the total balance sheet it has (&#34;estimated value&#34;) has important security considerations, and is done intentionally. If this value were measured against external systems, it could be purposely manipulated by an attacker to withdraw more assets than they otherwise should be able to claim by redeeming their shares. On deposit, this means that shares are issued against the total amount that the deposited capital can be given in service of the debt that Strategies assume. If that number were to be lower than the &#34;expected value&#34; at some future point, depositing shares via this method could entitle the depositor to *less* than the deposited value once the &#34;realized value&#34; is updated from further reports by the Strategies to the Vaults. Care should be taken by integrators to account for this discrepancy, by using the view-only methods of this contract (both off-chain and on-chain) to determine if depositing into the Vault is a &#34;good idea&#34;.*


#### Parameters:
| Name                           | Type          | Description                                    |

```solidity
function maxAvailableShares()
```


Determines the maximum quantity of shares this Vault can facilitate a withdrawal for, factoring in assets currently residing in the Vault, as well as those deployed to strategies on the Vault&#39;s balance sheet.    


*Regarding how shares are calculated, see dev note on `deposit`. If you want to calculated the maximum a user could withdraw up to, you want to use this function. Note that the amount provided by this function is the theoretical maximum possible from withdrawing, the real amount depends on the realized losses incurred during withdrawal.*



#### Return Values:
| Description                                                                  |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  * The total quantity of shares this Vault can provide. * |






### withdraw
```solidity
function withdraw()
```


Withdraws the calling account&#39;s tokens from this Vault, redeeming amount `_shares` for an appropriate amount of tokens. See note on `setWithdrawalQueue` for further details of withdrawal ordering and behavior.    


*Measuring the value of shares is based on the total outstanding debt that this contract has (&#34;expected value&#34;) instead of the total balance sheet it has (&#34;estimated value&#34;) has important security considerations, and is done intentionally. If this value were measured against external systems, it could be purposely manipulated by an attacker to withdraw more assets than they otherwise should be able to claim by redeeming their shares. On withdrawal, this means that shares are redeemed against the total amount that the deposited capital had &#34;realized&#34; since the point it was deposited, up until the point it was withdrawn. If that number were to be higher than the &#34;expected value&#34; at some future point, withdrawing shares via this method could entitle the depositor to *more* than the expected value once the &#34;realized value&#34; is updated from further reports by the Strategies to the Vaults. Under exceptional scenarios, this could cause earlier withdrawals to earn &#34;more&#34; of the underlying assets than Users might otherwise be entitled to, if the Vault&#39;s estimated value were otherwise measured through external means, accounting for whatever exceptional scenarios exist for the Vault (that aren&#39;t covered by the Vault&#39;s own design.) In the situation where a large withdrawal happens, it can empty the vault balance and the strategies in the withdrawal queue. Strategies not in the withdrawal queue will have to be harvested to rebalance the funds and make the funds available again to withdraw.*

The latter scenario could be for any reason that is considered &#34;critical&#34; that the Strategy exits its position as fast as possible, such as a sudden change in market conditions leading to losses, or an imminent failure in an external dependency. This may only be called by governance, the guardian, or the Strategy itself. Note that a Strategy will only revoke itself during emergency shutdown.

### removeStrategyFromQueue
```solidity
function removeStrategyFromQueue(address)
```

### report
```solidity
function report(uint256,uint256,uint256)
```


Reports the amount of assets the calling Strategy has free (usually in terms of ROI). The performance fee is determined here, off of the strategy&#39;s profits (if any), and sent to governance. The strategist&#39;s fee is also determined here (off of profits), to be handled according to the strategist on the next harvest. This may only be called by a Strategy managed by this Vault.    


*For approved strategies, this is the most efficient behavior. The Strategy reports back what it has free, then Vault &#34;decides&#34; whether to take some back or give it more. Note that the most it can take is `gain + _debtPayment`, and the most it can give is all of the remaining reserves. Anything outside of those bounds is abnormal behavior. All approved strategies must have increased diligence around calling this function, as abnormal behavior could become catastrophic.*


#### Parameters:
| Name                           | Type          | Description                                    |
| :----------------------------- | :------------ | :--------------------------------------------- |
|  * gain * |  *  * |  * Amount Strategy has realized as a gain on it's investment since its last report, and is free to be given back to Vault as earnings * |
|  * loss * |  *  * |  * Amount Strategy has realized as a loss on it's investment since its last report, and should be accounted for on the Vault's balance sheet. The loss will reduce the debtRatio. The next time the strategy will harvest, it will pay back the debt in an attempt to adjust to the new debt limit. * |
|  * _debtPayment * |  *  * |  * Amount Strategy has made available to cover outstanding debt * |



#### Return Values:
| Description                                                                  |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  * Amount of debt outstanding (if totalDebt > debtLimit or emergency shutdown). * |






### sweep
```solidity
function sweep(address)
```
