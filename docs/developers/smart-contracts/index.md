# Smart Contracts

This section includes documentation for the different versions and releases of the Yearn yVault smart contracts. Contracts are organized by major version and then split into current and deprecated sections with the most current version of the contracts living in the "current" folder and old releases in the "deprecated" folder.

The smart contract documentation is created directly from the NatSpec documentation of the files in the corresponding github repos for each version.
