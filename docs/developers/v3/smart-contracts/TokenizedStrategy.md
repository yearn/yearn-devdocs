# TokenizedStrategy

[Git Source](https://github.com/yearn/tokenized-strategy/blob/v3.0.2-1/src/TokenizedStrategy.sol)

**Author:**

This TokenizedStrategy can be used by anyone wishing to easily build
and deploy their own custom ERC4626 compliant single strategy Vault.
The TokenizedStrategy contract is meant to be used as the proxy
implementation contract that will handle all logic, storage and
management for a custom strategy that inherits the `BaseStrategy`.
Any function calls to the strategy that are not defined within that
strategy will be forwarded through a delegateCall to this contract.
A strategist only needs to override a few simple functions that are
focused entirely on the strategy specific needs to easily and cheaply
deploy their own permissionless 4626 compliant vault.

## State Variables

### API_VERSION

API version this TokenizedStrategy implements.

```solidity
string internal constant API_VERSION = "3.0.2";
```

### MAX_FEE

Maximum in Basis Points the Performance Fee can be set to.

```solidity
uint16 public constant MAX_FEE = 5_000;
```

### BASE_STRATEGY_STORAGE

*Custom storage slot that will be used to store the
`StrategyData` struct that holds each strategies
specific storage variables.
Any storage updates done by the TokenizedStrategy actually update
the storage of the calling contract. This variable points
to the specific location that will be used to store the
struct that holds all that data.
We use a custom string in order to get a random
storage slot that will allow for strategists to use any
amount of storage in their strategy without worrying
about collisions.*

```solidity
bytes32 internal constant BASE_STRATEGY_STORAGE = bytes32(uint256(keccak256("yearn.base.strategy.storage")) - 1);
```

### FACTORY

Address of the previously deployed Vault factory that the

```solidity
address public immutable FACTORY;
```

## Functions

### onlyManagement

*Require that the call is coming from the strategies management.*

```solidity
modifier onlyManagement();
```

### onlyKeepers

*Require that the call is coming from either the strategies
management or the keeper.*

```solidity
modifier onlyKeepers();
```

### onlyEmergencyAuthorized

*Require that the call is coming from either the strategies
management or the emergencyAdmin.*

```solidity
modifier onlyEmergencyAuthorized();
```

### nonReentrant

*Prevents a contract from calling itself, directly or indirectly.
Placed over all state changing functions for increased safety.*

```solidity
modifier nonReentrant();
```

### requireManagement

Require a caller is `management`.

*Is left public so that it can be used by the Strategy.
When the Strategy calls this the msg.sender would be the
address of the strategy so we need to specify the sender.*

```solidity
function requireManagement(address _sender) public view;
```

**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_sender`|`address`|The original msg.sender.|

### requireKeeperOrManagement

Require a caller is the `keeper` or `management`.

*Is left public so that it can be used by the Strategy.
When the Strategy calls this the msg.sender would be the
address of the strategy so we need to specify the sender.*

```solidity
function requireKeeperOrManagement(address _sender) public view;
```

**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_sender`|`address`|The original msg.sender.|

### requireEmergencyAuthorized

Require a caller is the `management` or `emergencyAdmin`.

*Is left public so that it can be used by the Strategy.
When the Strategy calls this the msg.sender would be the
address of the strategy so we need to specify the sender.*

```solidity
function requireEmergencyAuthorized(address _sender) public view;
```

**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_sender`|`address`|The original msg.sender.|

### _strategyStorage

*will return the actual storage slot where the strategy
specific `StrategyData` struct is stored for both read
and write operations.
This loads just the slot location, not the full struct
so it can be used in a gas efficient manner.*

```solidity
function _strategyStorage() internal pure returns (StrategyData storage S);
```

### initialize

Used to initialize storage for a newly deployed strategy.

*This should be called atomically whenever a new strategy is
deployed and can only be called once for each strategy.
This will set all the default storage that must be set for a
strategy to function. Any changes can be made post deployment
through external calls from `management`.
The function will also emit an event that off chain indexers can
look for to track any new deployments using this TokenizedStrategy.*

    address _asset,
    string memory _name,
    address _management,

*Internal implementation of [totalSupply](#totalsupply).*

```solidity
function _totalSupply(StrategyData storage S) internal view returns (uint256);
```

### _convertToShares

*Internal implementation of [convertToShares](#converttoshares).*

function _convertToShares(StrategyData storage S, uint256 assets, Math.Rounding _rounding)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256);
```

### _convertToAssets

*Internal implementation of [convertToAssets](#converttoassets).*

function _convertToAssets(StrategyData storage S, uint256 shares, Math.Rounding _rounding)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256);
```

```solidity
function _maxDeposit(StrategyData storage S, address owner) internal view returns (uint256);
```

### _maxMint

*Internal implementation of [maxMint](#maxmint).*

```solidity
function _maxMint(StrategyData storage S, address owner) internal view returns (uint256 maxMint_);
```

### _maxWithdraw

*Internal implementation of [maxWithdraw](#maxwithdraw).*

```solidity
function _maxWithdraw(StrategyData storage S, address owner) internal view returns (uint256 maxWithdraw_);
```

### _maxRedeem

*Internal implementation of [maxRedeem](#maxredeem).*

```solidity
function _maxRedeem(StrategyData storage S, address owner) internal view returns (uint256 maxRedeem_);
```

### _deposit

*Function to be called during [deposit](#deposit) and [mint](#mint).
This function handles all logic including transfers,
minting and accounting.
We do all external calls before updating any internal
values to prevent view reentrancy issues from the token
transfers or the _deployFunds() calls.*

```solidity
function _deposit(StrategyData storage S, address receiver, uint256 assets, uint256 shares) internal;
```

### _withdraw

*To be called during [redeem](#redeem) and [withdraw](#withdraw).
This will handle all logic, transfers and accounting
in order to service the withdraw request.
If we are not able to withdraw the full amount needed, it will
be counted as a loss and passed on to the user.*

```solidity
function _withdraw(
    StrategyData storage S,
    address receiver,
    address owner,
    uint256 assets,
    uint256 shares,
    uint256 maxLoss
) internal returns (uint256);
```

### report

Function for keepers to call to harvest and record all
profits accrued.

*This will account for any gains/losses since the last report
and charge fees accordingly.
Any profit over the fees charged will be immediately locked
so there is no change in PricePerShare. Then slowly unlocked
over the `maxProfitUnlockTime` each second based on the
calculated `profitUnlockingRate`.
In case of a loss it will first attempt to offset the loss
with any remaining locked shares from the last report in
order to reduce any negative impact to PPS.
Will then recalculate the new time to unlock profits over and the
rate based on a weighted average of any remaining time from the
last report and the new amount of shares to be locked.*

```solidity
function report() external nonReentrant onlyKeepers returns (uint256 profit, uint256 loss);
```

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`profit`|`uint256`|The notional amount of gain if any since the last report in terms of `asset`.|

### _unlockedShares

*To determine how many of the shares that were locked during the last
report have since unlocked.
If the `fullProfitUnlockDate` has passed the full strategy's balance will
count as unlocked.*

```solidity
function _unlockedShares(StrategyData storage S) internal view returns (uint256 unlocked);
```

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`unlocked`|`uint256`|The amount of shares that have unlocked.|

### tend

For a 'keeper' to 'tend' the strategy if a custom
tendTrigger() is implemented.

*Both 'tendTrigger' and '_tend' will need to be overridden
for this to be used.
This will callback the internal '_tend' call in the BaseStrategy
with the total current amount available to the strategy to deploy.
This is a permissioned function so if desired it could
be used for illiquid or manipulatable strategies to compound
rewards, perform maintenance or deposit/withdraw funds.
This will not cause any change in PPS. Total assets will
be the same before and after.
A report() call will be needed to record any profits or losses.*

```solidity
function tend() external nonReentrant onlyKeepers;
```

### shutdownStrategy

Used to shutdown the strategy preventing any further deposits.

*Can only be called by the current `management` or `emergencyAdmin`.
This will stop any new [deposit](#deposit) or [mint](#mint) calls but will
not prevent [withdraw](#withdraw) or [redeem](#redeem). It will also still allow for
[tend](#tend) and [report](#report) so that management can report any last losses
in an emergency as well as provide any maintenance to allow for full
withdraw.
This is a one way switch and can never be set back once shutdown.*

```solidity
function shutdownStrategy() external onlyEmergencyAuthorized;
```

### emergencyWithdraw

To manually withdraw funds from the yield source after a
strategy has been shutdown.

*This can only be called post [shutdownStrategy](#shutdownstrategy).
This will never cause a change in PPS. Total assets will
be the same before and after.
A strategist will need to override the `_emergencyWithdraw` function
in their strategy for this to work.*

```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant onlyEmergencyAuthorized;
```

Transfer '_amount` of shares from `msg.sender` to `to`.

*

Requirements:

* `to` cannot be the zero address.
* `to` cannot be the address of the strategy.
* the caller must have a balance of at least `_amount`.*

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
```

|`<none>`|`bool`|. a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.|

### allowance

Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be
allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through [transferFrom](#transferfrom). This is
zero by default.
This value changes when [approve](#approve) or [transferFrom](#transferfrom) are called.

```solidity
function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
```

**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`owner`|`address`|The address who owns the shares.|

### _allowance

*Internal implementation of [allowance](#allowance).*

```solidity
function _allowance(StrategyData storage S, address owner, address spender) internal view returns (uint256);
```

### approve

Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` over the caller's tokens.

*

NOTE: If `amount` is the maximum `uint256`, the allowance is not updated on
`transferFrom`. This is semantically equivalent to an infinite approval.
Requirements:

* `spender` cannot be the zero address.
IMPORTANT: Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk
that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate
transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race
condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the
desired value afterwards:
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729
Emits an [Approval](#approval) event.*

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

|`amount`|`uint256`|the amount of shares to allow `spender` to move.|

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`<none>`|`bool`|. a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.|

### transferFrom

`amount` tokens from `from` to `to` using the
allowance mechanism. `amount` is then deducted from the caller's
allowance.

*

Emits an [Approval](#approval) event indicating the updated allowance. This is not
required by the EIP.
NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance
is the maximum `uint256`.
Requirements:

* `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address.
* `to` cannot be the address of the strategy.
* `from` must have a balance of at least `amount`.

```solidity
function _mint(StrategyData storage S, address account, uint256 amount) internal;
```

### _burn

function _spendAllowance(StrategyData storage S, address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) internal;
```

### nonces

Returns the current nonce for `owner`. This value must be
included whenever a signature is generated for [permit](#permit).

*IMPORTANT: The same issues [IERC20-approve](/lib/erc4626-tests/ERC4626.prop.sol/interface.IERC20.md#approve) has related to transaction
ordering also apply here.
Emits an Approval event.
Requirements:

* `spender` cannot be the zero address.
* `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.
* `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`
over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.

function permit(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
    external;
```

### DOMAIN_SEPARATOR

Returns the domain separator used in the encoding of the signature
for [permit](#permit), as defined by `EIP712`.

*This checks that the current chain id is the same as when the contract
was deployed to prevent replay attacks. If false it will calculate a new
domain separator based on the new chain id.*

```solidity
function DOMAIN_SEPARATOR() public view returns (bytes32);
```

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`<none>`|`bytes32`|. The domain separator that will be used for any [permit](#permit) calls.|

### _computeDomainSeparator

*Calculates and returns the domain separator to be used in any
permit functions for the strategies [permit](#permit) calls.
This will be used at the initialization of each new strategies storage.
It would then be used in the future in the case of any forks in which
the current chain id is not the same as the original.*

```solidity
function _computeDomainSeparator(StrategyData storage S) internal view returns (bytes32);
```

### constructor

*On contract creation we set `asset` for this contract to address(1).
This prevents it from ever being initialized in the future.*

```solidity
constructor(address _factory);
```

**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_factory`|`address`|Address of the factory of the same version for protocol fees.|

```

## Structs

### StrategyData

*The struct that will hold all the storage data for each strategy
that uses this implementation.
This replaces all state variables for a traditional contract. This
full struct will be initialized on the creation of the strategy
and continually updated and read from for the life of the contract.
We combine all the variables into one struct to limit the amount of
times the custom storage slots need to be loaded during complex functions.
Loading the corresponding storage slot for the struct does not
load any of the contents of the struct into memory. So the size
will not increase memory related gas usage.*

```solidity
struct StrategyData {
    ERC20 asset;
    uint8 decimals;
    uint88 INITIAL_CHAIN_ID;
    string name;
    uint256 totalSupply;
    bytes32 INITIAL_DOMAIN_SEPARATOR;
    mapping(address => uint256) nonces;
    mapping(address => uint256) balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) allowances;
    uint256 totalAssets;
    uint256 profitUnlockingRate;
    uint96 fullProfitUnlockDate;
    address keeper;
