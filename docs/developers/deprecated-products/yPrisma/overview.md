## What is yPRISMA?

yPRISMA is Yearn's latest liquid locker, built for Prisma Finance's governance token (PRISMA). Let's review the basics of liquid locker tokens like yPRISMA:

- They represent 1 vePRISMA max-locked to Yearn
- They are not redeemable for the underlying locked PRISMA
- They have no transfer restrictions and thus can always be swapped in DEX pools

Governance for Prisma is controlled by vePRISMA, a locked token position that grants users voting power, fee revenue, and boosted PRISMA emissions.

Because all PRISMA emissions come as locked vePRISMA, it is often inconvenient for users who want to avoid managing their position or want to cash out. yPRISMA aims to offer users a tokenized version of this position, giving them instant liquidity and auto-managing governance participation to maximize yield.

Yearn has 2 ways to earn yield on your yPRISMA; depositing to the `YearnBoostedStaker` contract to earn mkUSD or depositing to the yPRISMA Auto-Compounder V3 vault to earn more yPRISMA.
