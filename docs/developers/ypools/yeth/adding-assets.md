# Adding Assets to yETH

:::info[Prerequisites]

You will need access to the necessary governance contracts and a sufficient voting weight of at least 100 to create proposals. You can check your voting weight [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x583019fF0f430721aDa9cfb4fac8F06cA104d0B4#readContract#F13).

## Step 1: Enable One-Off Inclusion Vote

Since the adoption of [this proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/ylsd.eth/proposal/0x139698bed7752b80a16bb6d2fc0d9e8c82b622916ded2f064022be3c46ec9bb4), inclusion voting is off by default and needs to be enabled for the next epoch. Here is how you do that.

To enable a one-off inclusion vote, a governance call must be made to the `set_enable_epoch(next_epoch)` function on the [InclusionVote contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6bc0878939669339e82dbFa13d260c89230f2c31#code). This requires crafting and getting a governance proposal approved. Follow the instructions below:

1. Create the text of your proposal and pin it to IPFS. The ipfs_hash should point to a document hosted on IPFS with details explaining the proposal and its rationale. You can host your own IPFS document or use a provider like [Pi√±ata](https://pinata.cloud/). For this, you should explain why you want to enable an inclusion vote, what assets you want to propose, etc.

2. Generate a script by calling the `script(_to, _data)` view function on the yPools [Executor contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x71258Ee726644f1D52d6A9F5E11C21d1E38c2bF1#readContract#F1). In this case, you want this script to call `set_enable_epoch()` on the InclusionVote contract with the value of the next epoch.

    - Set the`_to(address)` field to the [InclusionVote contract](../../addresses/ypools-contracts.md#yeth-contract-addresses): `0x6bc0878939669339e82dbFa13d260c89230f2c31`.
    - Then create the ABI-encoded data for the function `set_enable_epoch()` with the argument set to the next epoch. Below is a ABI encoding widget that you can use. It should be pre-populated with the correct contract and function, but you need to enter the next epoch into the "Function Argument" box. The current epoch should be listed at the top of this page in the `Live Governance Info` admonition. Just add 1 to that number. Then hit "Encode" and take the output from the widget and put it in the `_data(bytes)` field on etherscan.
    - Click `query` and copy the result.

<!-- get next epoch value for functionArg. get epoch from rpc call passed to wrapper -->
   <AbiEncodingWidget defaultAbi='yPoolsInclusionVoteABI' defaultFunction='set_enable_epoch'/>

3. You can now create the proposal via the [proposal page](https://yeth.yearn.fi/propose) or directly by calling the `propose(ipfs_hash, script)` function on the [GenericGovernor contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB7a528CF6D36F736Fa678A629b98A427d43E5ba5). Enter the IPFS pin and the script value that you created in steps one and 2.

4. Once the proposal is created, the governance process will need to:
    - Approve the proposal.
    - Execute the set_enable_epoch(next_epoch) function to enable the inclusion vote for the next epoch.

## Step 2: Apply for Inclusion

To apply to have an LST included in yETH's basket of tokens, you will need to fill out the application form and pay a non-refundable application fee. Any token that has applied for inclusion and has a rate provider set by Yearn will be eligible for the inclusion vote that was enabled above.

## Step 3: Outcome

Once the vote is complete, the winner (if any) will be included into yETH.
