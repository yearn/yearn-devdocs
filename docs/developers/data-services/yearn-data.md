# Yearn Data Services

If you want to programmatically interact with Yearn data, or need to fetch large amounts of it then you have a few options:

## yDaemon

yDaemon is a RESTful API that hydrates subgraph responses with more data, like APY calculations. yDaemon is the best source for current yearn Vault data and is what is used by the production Yearn front ends.

## Kong

[Kong](https://kong.yearn.farm/) is an integrated set of services and tools that make it easy to index EVM logs and state, enrich your data with custom hooks, query your data over graphql. Kong is designed to be cheap, reliable, easy to maintain, and simplify the process of updating your index.

Kong's Yearn index covers the v3 and v2 vault ecosystems:

- Regular contract snapshots of each registry, vault, strategy, trade handler, accountant, and debt allocator.
- Full event history for each of the above (*with limited history on transfers, deposits, withdraws, and approves).
- Snapshot hooks for computing vault-strategies relationships, debts, fees, and rewards.
- Snapshot hooks for integrating off-chain risk and meta data.
- Event hooks for tracking new vaults and strategies, computing spot harvest APRs, and pricing transfers.
- Timeseries hooks for computing APY and TVL.

Kong can be run locally or a hosted version run by Yearn can be queried with the public endpoint.

## Subgraph

:::info

Currently only subgraphs for V2 vaults are available and some subgraphs have not been migrated to the new service. We recommend using Kong or yDaemon for your data needs.

:::

The subgraph is a GraphQL interface to query raw historical data. For current data it is recommended to check yDaemon before using the subgraph directly.
