### How to zap from CRV or yCRV to any of the 3 types of reward tokens

As yCRV is the base-token and carries no native yield or voting power, you'll likely want to position yourself into one of the three activated-tokens.

1) Go to [yCRV interface](https://ycrvdev.yearn.farm/) and decide which token you want to zap to. You can zap from either CRV or yCRV:
    - [**st-yCRV (Staking Rewards):**](#staked-ycrv) [yVault](https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-finance-explained-what-are-vaults-and-strategies-96970560432) that receives admin fees and bribes from locked CRV.
    - [**lp-yCRV (Liquidity Pool Rewards):**](#lpd-ycrvcrv) yVault for CRV/yCRV LP tokens, autocompounds emissions and fees.
    - [**st-yCRV (Curve Gauges Voting Power):**](#voting-with-ycrv) Vote power mechanism to vote on Curve gauge weights.
