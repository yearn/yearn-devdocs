## Overview

**V3 Vaults are the newest, shiniest yVaults. More flexibility, better security, more Yearn goodness!**

Yearn's v3 yVaults are a decentralized suite of yield-generating products built to fit any need. They are designed to be un-opinionated and customizable infrastructure for the world to build on, making yield generation as safe, efficient, and easy as possible for all parties.

Version 3 of yVaults iterates on Version 2 by increasing its robustness and developing Yearnâ€™s path towards further decentralization, while keeping the same proven product (yield-bearing tokens). Version 3 has all the same functionality as Version 2, but with many more added benefits and improvements to continue to grow the Yearn ecosystem.

V3 also sees the introduction of "Tokenized Strategies". Strategies are now capable of being standalone 4626 vaults themselves. These single-strategy vaults can be used as stand-alone vaults or easily added as a strategy to a Multi-Strategy Vault.
