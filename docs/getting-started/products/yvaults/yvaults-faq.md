## yVaults ELI-5

Yearn Vaults are contracts on the Ethereum blockchainâ€”and the layer2 networks that sit atop it. They allow you to deposit cryptocurrency tokens you own and earn interest on them. When you deposit, your tokens are combined with other depositors' tokens and directed toward interest earning opportunities. How and which opportunities are chosen depends on the *Strategies* used by the vault. You receive a receipt token (aka a Vault Token) that can be used to retrieve your original deposit plus any interest earned.
