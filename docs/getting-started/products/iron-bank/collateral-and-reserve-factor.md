# Overview

## Introduction

The Iron Bank provides a lending service both to users and protocols. For protocols that are whitelisted this can be zero-collateral loans. For users, this will be an overcollateralised loan.

## Collateral & Reserve Factor

The reserve factor is the percentage of fee paid to the Iron Bank. If the reserve factor is 10, then that would imply that 10% of the interest paid on the asset is for the Iron Bank.

In the other hand, the collateral factor is the maximum you can borrow on a particular asset.

Example: The collateral factor for ETH is 85%, if the price of ETH is considered as $1000, the max you will be able to borrow in other assets is worth $850
