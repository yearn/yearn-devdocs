# Overview


## What is yBribe?

[yBribe](https://ybribe.yearn.farm) is a platform where vote-escrowed Curve (veCRV) holders can receive compensation from buyers interested in increasing CRV emissions to their Curve pool’s gauge.

In DeFi, incentives for voting are commonly referred to as ‘bribes’. yBribe enables veCRV holders — be they protocols, DAOs, or individual users, to extract the value of their voting power.

**yBribe pairs users looking to buy votes, with those looking to sell them.**

Curve conducts weekly gauge votes that determine the allocation of CRV rewards to various pools. By buying votes, DAOs, protocols, and users can influence the direction of these rewards and boost yields in pools beneficial to them. To do this, use the ‘Bribe a Gauge’ function on yBribe. Once the bribe is posted, voters will see the pending APR for the gauge increase.

veCRV holders can sell their gauge votes to the highest bidder each week by voting on the bribed gauge with the highest APR.
