# Introduction to Yearn PRISMA Incentives Farming

The Prisma Wars are officially underway, which means full steam ahead for yPRISMA, Yearn's newest tokenized locker product.

Yearn has claimed its PRISMA airdrop as yPRISMA and is preparing to distribute these tokens to yCRV users and yPRISMA LPs. 

This post will outline exactly how that will work.

### What's happening with Yearn's veCRV Airdrop?

The roughly 280,000 yPRISMA tokens received from the airdrop will be distributed across two simple staking contracts: one for yCRV and another for yPRISMA LPs.

If you are a user in the yCRV ecosystem, you may choose to migrate your position to the new staking contract on yprisma.yearn.fi to farm yPRISMA. 

Fortunately, even those who choose not to migrate should expect an APR increase thanks to users leaving st-yCRV and lp-yCRV to chase the new yPRISMA yield: A win-win!

## What do I do with yPRISMA?

As the Prisma protocol continues progressing towards native yield distribution to vePRISMA lockers, Yearn has approved an incentive program for yPRISMA stakers. This will provide a direct source of yield for yPRISMA users until native fee distribution is live.

When ready, any yPRISMA holder can stake to earn wstETH rewards.

## Rewards Breakdown

The breakdown of the scheduled events will be as follows:

| Deposit Token | Reward Token | Reward Token amount | Start time|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |----|
