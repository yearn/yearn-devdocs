# Curating On Term

![image](/img/curating/term.jpg)

Term Finance enables noncustodial, fixed-rate over-collateralized lending on-chain. Yearn-curated Term Vaults take the deposited underlying asset and allocate it into a Yearn v3 allocator or a single-strategy vault. When a borrower requests funds, the requested amount is withdrawn from the underlying Yearn vault. The borrowing rate is targeted to be at least 1-2% more than the 30-day average APY of the Yearn vault where the funds are deposited. This design ensures that Term Vault depositors always earn at least the base yield provided by Yearn v3 vaults.
