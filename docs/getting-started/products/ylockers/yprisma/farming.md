# yPRISMA FAQ

The Prisma Wars are officially underway, which means full steam ahead for yPRISMA: Yearn's newest tokenized locker product.

Yearn has claimed its PRISMA airdrop as yPRISMA and is preparing to distribute these tokens to yCRV users and yPRISMA LPs. 

This post will outline exactly how that will work.

### What's happening with Yearn's veCRV Airdrop?

The roughly 280,000 yPRISMA tokens minted from Yearn's airdrop claim will be distributed across two simple staking contracts: yCRV and yPRISMA LPs.

If you are a user in the yCRV ecosystem you may migrate your position by withdrawing to vanilla yCRV and depositing it into the new staking contract on https://yprisma.yearn.fi to earn yPRISMA rewards.

## What do I do with yPRISMA?

The yPRISMA ecosystem aims to deliver a user experience similar to yCRV, which passes all protocol yield earned by Yearn's position along to users.

A staking contract is available on the yPRISMA [website](https://yprisma.yearn.fi/), allowing users to stake their yPRISMA to earn protocol fees and bribes.

## Can yPRISMA users vote in Primsa?

Weekly incentive voting is automated to optimize for the maximum weekly bribe yield.

There is active research on Prisma governance proposals to determine how to pass Yearn's voting power along to yPRISMA users.
