# yPrisma

:::warning

 yPrisma has been deprecated and all PRISMA and yPRISMA tokens can be migrated to the native token of Resupply (RSUP).

 :::

Please head over to the ReSupply docs to find out how to migrate.

**Guide on how to migrate from PRISMA, yPRISMA, or cvxPRISMA**: https://docs.resupply.fi/how-to-guides/using-resupply/redeeming-prisma-for-vesting-rsup-tokens

> The Redeem PRISMA feature allows users to convert their Prisma-based tokens (PRISMA, cvxPRISMA, and yPRISMA) into a vesting allocation of RSUP tokens. This process allows Prisma token holders to convert to RSUP tokens. This can be found [here](https://resupply.fi/governance/rsup) below the Stake RSUP section. **In order to see this section you must have a wallet with Prisma, cvxPrisma, or yPrisma connected.**

If you still need to find something from the old yPRISMA docs you can find them [here](/resources/deprecated/yPrisma/overview).
