# Launch and Migration FAQ

### When will yCRV launch?
Contracts are live, you can find relevant addresses [here](https://docs.yearn.fi/getting-started/products/ylockers/ycrv/overview#addresses).

### Should I migrate now from yveCRV and yvBOOST?
Yes! Incentives have moved to the new system. yveCRV and yvBOOST will no longer receive yield.

### What happens to yveCRV and yvBOOST?
yveCRV and yvBOOST are being deprecated, and there is a migration path available to users. yCRV can be minted 1:1 from yveCRV. yCRV can be minted `1 * pricePerShare` of yvBOOST at the time of migration. There will be a migration zap available to all users to make this easy.

### Will I get rewards if I don't migrate?
No. After the cut-over date, all incentives will move to the new yCRV system.

### Is there a deadline for migration?
Nope! You can migrate anytime in the future. Contracts are trustless and migrations cannot be stopped.

### How are Curve DAO governance votes handled in this system?
The Yearn [governance multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfeb4acf3df3cdea7399794d0869ef76a6efaff52) will retain the sole ability to cast votes in the Curve DAO. They will do so with close consultation with the [Crypto Risk Team](https://twitter.com/cryptorisksteam) and other Curve DAO stakeholders to ensure risk is properly assessed and all votes promote the long-term interests of the Curve DAO. While it is possible that the yCRV system can be upgraded to someday grant these voting rights to yCRV token holders (only if enforcing a sufficiently long lock time), there is no current plan to do so.
