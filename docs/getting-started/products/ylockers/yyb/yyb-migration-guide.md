## Migrate veYB to yYB

In order to make any veYB position transferrable, you must first clear existing gauge weight and max lock your YB. Once complete, you may migrate to yYB 1:1.

### Step 1

First, you need to remove your gauge weight allocations. If you have voted recently, you will need to wait 10 days since your last vote before you can clear your votes.

### Step 2

Once you've cleared your votes, you will be instructed to lock your YB for the maximum duration (also known as "permalocking").

### Step 3

You can now migrate your veYB to yYB by transferring your permalocked veYB to Yearn in exchange for yYB tokens at a 1:1 ratio.
