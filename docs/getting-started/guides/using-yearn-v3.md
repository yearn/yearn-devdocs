4. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the transaction. It should confirm within a minute, but if your transaction gets stuck, see [this guide](https://support.metamask.io/transactions-and-gas/transactions/how-to-speed-up-or-cancel-a-pending-transaction/) on how to speed up or cancel the transaction.

## Tools to track your funds

If you would like to see how your USD balance changes while your assets are in a vault, connect your wallet to [Zapper.xyz](https://zapper.xyz) or a similar portfolio-tracking product. This is also the easiest way to tell how much profit the vault has made for you.

Your balance WILL NOT increase continuously. Profit will be distributed to your share of the vault when the harvest() function is called, which happens on a fluctuating basis.
