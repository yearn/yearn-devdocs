# Using Yearn's V3 Vaults

So you want to deposit into one of Yearn's V3 Vaults? You are in the right spot. Keep reading for a full walkthrough on how to use them.

## Connect your Wallet

First, **Connect your wallet** using the button at the top right corner. Multiple wallets are supported, but most people use [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), which can be downloaded for free as a Chrome extension or through the Apple and Android app stores. Make sure that your wallet is connected to the Ethereum network.

4. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the transaction. It should confirm within a minute, but if your transaction gets stuck, see [this guide](https://support.metamask.io/transactions-and-gas/transactions/how-to-speed-up-or-cancel-a-pending-transaction/) on how to speed up or cancel the transaction.

## Tools to track your funds

If you would like to see how your USD balance changes while your assets are in a vault, connect your wallet to [DeBank](https://debank.com/), [Zerion](https://app.zerion.io/), [Zapper.xyz](https://zapper.xyz), or a similar portfolio-tracking product. This is also the easiest way to tell how much profit the vault has made for you.
