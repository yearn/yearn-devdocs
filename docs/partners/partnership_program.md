title: Partnership Program
---

If you want to integrate DeFi for your users to let them earn yields on their accounts you can do this now with our partnership program.

Yearn Partners aims to make Yearn vaults accessible from virtually anywhere. Any protocol that integrates Yearn vaults can earn up to a 50% profit share from their contributed TVL. The Partnership program is being tested, audited, and we’ll commence a gradual release with selected Partners over the coming months.

If you are interested in partnering with us, we’d love to hear from you! Please reach out to us [here](https://yearnfinance.typeform.com/to/uP7xOJUN)

## Profit Share

We offer profit share based on Total TVL contributed across all vaults. This is our total fees generated, deducted by overhead costs to maintain and operate the vaults. For now, we are paying out profit shares manually, retroactively, but we want to move it on-chain as the program matures.

The profit sharing is paid out in the vault tokens that you have TVL in.

This is the payout table we have set:  

- Yearn’s total fees to the end users are 2% mgmt fee and 20% performance fee.
- 50% of the performance fee goes to the strategist writing the investment strategy used.
- What remains is yearn’s revenues. From there ~35% is deducted for our overheads, which includes security, operations, headcount etc.
- What’s left is shared with you based on the Tier you end up in, based on the combined TVL you contribute with during the period.

Tiers are what determine the percentage of profit shared with the partner. They are calculated based on total TVL provided across all vaults. You can see them in the table below.

| Tier | TVL contributed | Profit Share* |
|---|---|---|
1 | $1m-5m | 10%
2 | $5m-$10m | 15%
3 | $10-50m | 20%
4 | $50-$100m | 25%
5 | $100-$200m | 30%
6 | $200-400m | 35%
7 | $400-700m | 40%
8 | $700-1bn | 45%
9 | >$1bn | 50%

*) _Calculated by deducting 35% from Gross Revenue to cover operational costs._

So for example, let's assume:

1. The partner contributes on average with $400m TVL for a full year;
2. Average performance of your TVL in the vaults is 10.5%;
