We offer profit share based on Total TVL contributed across all vaults. This is our total fees generated, deducted by overhead costs to maintain and operate the vaults. For now, we are paying out profit shares manually, retroactively, but we want to move it on-chain as the program matures.

The profit sharing is paid out in the vault tokens that you have TVL in.

This is the payout table we have set:  

- Yearn’s total fees to the end users are 2% mgmt fee and 20% performance fee.
- 50% of the performance fee goes to the strategist writing the investment strategy used.
- What remains is yearn’s revenues. From there ~35% is deducted for our overheads, which includes security, operations, headcount etc.
- What’s left is shared with you based on the Tier you end up in, based on the combined TVL you contribute with during the period.

So for example, let's assume:

1. The partner contributes on average with $400m TVL for a full year;
2. Average performance of your TVL in the vaults is 10.5%;
