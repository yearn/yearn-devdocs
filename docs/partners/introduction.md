title: Partnership Program
---

Yearn's partnership program allows developers to easily integrate yield into their own services. 

In an effort to make yVaults accessible from virtually anywhere, any protocol that integrates yVaults can earn up to a 50% profit share from their contributed TVL. The Partnership program is being tested, audited, and we’ll commence a gradual release with selected Partners over the coming months.

If you are interested in partnering with us, we’d love to hear from you! Please reach out to us through [this form](https://yearnfinance.typeform.com/to/uP7xOJUN)

## Profit Share

We offer profit share based on Total TVL contributed across all vaults. This is our total fees generated, deducted by overhead costs to maintain and operate the vaults. For now, we are paying out profit shares manually, retroactively, but we want to move it on-chain as the program matures.

Profit-sharing is paid out in the native token of the vaults that partners are utilizing. 

This is the payout table we have set:  

- Yearn’s total fees to the end-users are 2% mgmt fee and 20% performance fee.
- 50% of the performance fee goes to the strategist writing the investment strategy used.
- What remains is yearn’s revenues. From there ~35% is deducted for our overheads, which includes security, operations, headcount, etc.
- What’s left is shared with you based on the Tier you end up in, based on the combined TVL you contribute with during the period.

Tiers are what determine the percentage of profit shared with the partner. They are calculated based on the total TVL provided across all vaults. You can see them in the table below.

| Tier | TVL contributed | Profit Share* |
|---|---|---|
1 | $1m-5m | 10%
2 | $5m-$10m | 15%
3 | $10-50m | 20%
4 | $50-$100m | 25%
5 | $100-$200m | 30%
6 | $200-400m | 35%
7 | $400-700m | 40%
8 | $700-1bn | 45%
9 | >$1bn | 50%
