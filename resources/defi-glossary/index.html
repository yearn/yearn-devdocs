<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="aave">Aave<a href="#aave" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Aave" title="Direct link to Aave">​</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://aave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aave</a> is an open-source and non-custodial lending protocol enabling the creation of money markets.</p>
<p>Users can earn interest on deposits and also borrow assets. Aave provides depositors a Liquidity Token that represents an equivalent derivative deposit in an identical asset.</p>
<p>For example, a user can deposit DAI and receive aDAI, which is a type of USD-based crypto derivative that essentially represents the value of the underlying DAI asset plus the interest gains from allowing the borrowing of one&#x27;s DAI. That aDAI, could then also be used to implement further strategies to potentially amplify their gains even further.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="alpha-code">Alpha Code<a href="#alpha-code" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alpha Code" title="Direct link to Alpha Code">​</a></h3>
<p>Early-stage prototype computer code, programs, and algorithms meant to solve a problem, and/or provide new digital goods or services. Alpha software comes with the expectation that the code is at an early prototype stage and is meant for an early testing phase meant for very limited testing.</p>
<p>Alpha code or software may be missing all or parts of expected software functionality. Planned features and the security of the software may also be very limited or even non-existent in many aspects.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="audit">Audit<a href="#audit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Audit" title="Direct link to Audit">​</a></h3>
<p>An audit is either an internal or independent comprehensive review of a concept, system, process, company, or product. A comprehensive audit includes a thoughtful and in-depth look at the structure, strengths, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities of the thing or process being audited.</p>
<p>Audits may be either informal or formal audits and are meant to be a tool to find and analyze weaknesses, so that issues and problems discovered during an audit may be remediated, mitigated, or corrected.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="apy">APY<a href="#apy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to APY" title="Direct link to APY">​</a></h3>
<p>Annual Percentage Yield, a time-based measurement of the Return On Investment (ROI) on an asset. For example, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>100</mn><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>v</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">100 invested at 2% APY would yield </annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em"></span><span class="mord">100</span><span class="mord mathnormal">in</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em">v</span><span class="mord mathnormal">es</span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mord mathnormal">d</span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="mord">2</span></span></span></span>102 after one year, if there is no compounding of any interest earned on that $100 through the year. Assuming a static APY rate, the Monthly ROI would be 0.16%, in this case.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="arbitrage">Arbitrage<a href="#arbitrage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Arbitrage" title="Direct link to Arbitrage">​</a></h3>
<p>The trading of a coin or crypto derivative, where the price spread between two different markets or exchanges for the same asset or product is utilized to earn greater profits.</p>
<p>In DeFi, automated yield farming uses algorithmic arbitrage strategies to maximize returns for investors. These arbitrage strategies may include buying, selling, lending, and/or providing liquidity of one or more digital assets, often in the same day.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="automated-market-maker">Automated Market Maker<a href="#automated-market-maker" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Automated Market Maker" title="Direct link to Automated Market Maker">​</a></h3>
<p>An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a decentralized asset trading pool that enables market participants to buy or sell cryptocurrencies. AMMs are non-custodial and permissionless in nature. Most AMMs utilize either a constant product, constant mean, or constant sum market-making formula; however, the most common is a constant product market maker, most notably <a href="https://uniswap.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="balancer">Balancer<a href="#balancer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Balancer" title="Direct link to Balancer">​</a></h3>
<p>From the <a href="https://balancer.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Balancer</a> whitepaper definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Balancer Pool is an automated market maker with certain key properties that cause it to function as a self-balancing weighted portfolio and price sensor.</p>
<p>Balancer turns the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities.</p>
<p>Balancer uses a Constant Mean Market Maker (CMMM)that enables non-equal weights for pools (e.g., 80/20 vs. 50/50) and also allows LPs to provide single-sided liquidity.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bear-market">Bear Market<a href="#bear-market" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bear Market" title="Direct link to Bear Market">​</a></h3>
<p>A period marked by prevailing negative investor sentiment about an asset or class of assets. A bear market can last weeks, months, or years.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="beta-code">Beta Code<a href="#beta-code" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Beta Code" title="Direct link to Beta Code">​</a></h3>
<p>Later stage prototype computer code, programs, and algorithms meant to solve a problem, and/or provide digital goods or services. Beta code comes with the expectation that the code has more functionality and stability as a mid-to-late stage prototype stage with a Beta testing phase, and that the software functionality, features, and security may still be limited.</p>
<p>The codebase, process, system, and/or network is often opened up to a limited number of testers who stress test systems and provide feedback for improvements to the developer or development team.</p>
<p>Beta code development has the expectation of being one of the critical final phases before the potential public release of Version 1.0 software. Beta software is used with the expectation and understanding that there may still be minor to fatal bugs or security vulnerabilities hidden within this Beta software code or associated processes that may not have been uncovered by previous security reviews, testing, or audits.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="blockchain">Blockchain<a href="#blockchain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Blockchain" title="Direct link to Blockchain">​</a></h3>
<p>An immutable permanent public record or ledger of all transactions since the beginning of a cryptocurrency coin or token.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bull-market">Bull market<a href="#bull-market" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bull market" title="Direct link to Bull market">​</a></h3>
<p>A period marked by prevailing positive investor sentiment about an asset or class of assets. A bull market can last weeks, months, or years, and can sometimes be marked by what economists call a Bubble, where there may be irrational overenthusiasm about an asset or class of assets, leading to explosive price growth followed by an explosive price crash.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cefi">CeFi<a href="#cefi" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to CeFi" title="Direct link to CeFi">​</a></h3>
<p>Centralized Finance. In terms of cryptocurrency, CeFi is represented by centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, businesses, or organizations with a physical address, and usually with some sort of corporate structure. These CeFi businesses must follow all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in each country, state, or region in which they operate.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cex">CEX<a href="#cex" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to CEX" title="Direct link to CEX">​</a></h3>
<p>A CEX is a Centralized Exchange, with a physical address and a corporate structure. Like other CeFi businesses, a CEX must follow all applicable laws, rules, money transmitter licenses, and regulations in each country, state, or region in which they operate. There are significant overhead costs in running a CEX including Corporate leaders, labor, rent and electricity, office supplies, significant legal expenses, and expensive money transmitter licenses to be able to operate in chosen countries, states, or regions.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="coin">Coin<a href="#coin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Coin" title="Direct link to Coin">​</a></h3>
<p>A form of digital currency primarily used for payments or storage of wealth. Coins are secured by encryption algorithms. The market price of the coin represents the value of the ownership of a divisible unit of the coin or token (another name for a coin, but a type of coin with greater functionality) at a given moment in time. This coin or token can represent a share of the ownership and/or governance of a coin, token, protocol, company, or project and all of the benefits that this may entail.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="collateralization">Collateralization<a href="#collateralization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Collateralization" title="Direct link to Collateralization">​</a></h3>
<p>The borrowing of a deposit asset or assets to seek further business activities such as Yield Farming. Collateralization can amplify gains or losses, and is thus, considered riskier than not borrowing funds.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="composability">Composability<a href="#composability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Composability" title="Direct link to Composability">​</a></h3>
<p>The measure of the usability and ability of the product to be used as a building block (or &quot;money lego&quot;) in the construction of other products or domains. A protocol that is simple, powerful, and that functions well with other protocols would be considered to have high composability.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="compound">Compound<a href="#compound" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Compound" title="Direct link to Compound">​</a></h3>
<p>The DeFi platform <a href="https://compound.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compound</a>. From the Compound DAO&#x27;s description:</p>

<p>Once called the eighth wonder of the world by Einstein, compound interest allows greater interest rates and returns on investments by allowing interest gained to be automatically reinvested back in with the original deposits and accrued interest. This reinvestment period is based on the planned distribution of this interest which may be hourly, weekly, monthly, or an annual interest distribution.</p>
<p>With compound interest, the greatest gains are often seen over a certain period in time, with a notably sharp rise in the value of investments seen at longer periods. In general, the longer a deposit benefits from compound interest, the much greater the overall gains when compared to gains made from simple interest.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="defi">DeFi<a href="#defi" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DeFi" title="Direct link to DeFi">​</a></h3>
<p>DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is at its root a set of Smart Contracts running independently on blockchains such as the Ethereum network. Smart Contracts may or may not interact with other smart contracts and even other blockchains.</p>
<p>The goal of DeFi is to enhance the profitability of investors in DeFi through automated smart contracts seeking to maximize yields for invested funds. DeFi is marked by rapid innovative progression and testing of new ideas and concepts.</p>
<p>DeFi often involves high risk investing sometimes involving smart contracts that have not been audited or even thoroughly reviewed (a review is not as comprehensive as an audit, but may also be included as part of an audit). Due to this and other reasons, DeFi is conventionally considered to be riskier than CeFi or traditional investing.</p>

<p>A Decentralized Autonomous Organization with access to Delegated Funds in the form of Liquidity Pool and governance tokens under delegated control. As of 2020, it is a new concept and seed investment strategy introduced by YFI Developer Andre Cronje that supports the development of Fair Launch coins, tokens, projects, and products that provide new ideas and concepts that support DeFi without taking any allocation of the coin, token, or share of ownership of the new project that applicants intend to be launched. It is meant to incentivize innovation from new or previous crypto builders and designers while being an experiment in providing a new avenue of procuring seed capital for DeFi builders and designers.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="derivative">Derivative<a href="#derivative" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Derivative" title="Direct link to Derivative">​</a></h3>
<p>In investing, a derivative is an investment instrument or tool that is based on an underlying asset or assets. Investopedia describes it thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Derivatives can be used to hedge a position, speculate on the directional movement of an underlying asset, or give leverage to holdings. Their value comes from the fluctuations of the values of the underlying asset. Originally, derivatives were used to ensure balanced exchange rates for goods traded internationally.</p>
<p>In DeFi, since 2020 there now exists a crypto derivative that is a new type of investment or asset class. This crypto derivative is a representation of an underlying digital base asset such as Ethereum, Dai, Curve, or YFI. Examples of their respective derivatives are yETH, aDAI, yCRV, and yYFI.</p>

<p>Gas fees are rewards paid to Proof Of Work miners to incentivize them to support the network&#x27;s transactions which become written to the blockchain. In Ethereum, this gas fee unit amount is expressed in gwei. Withdrawals or transfers to or from CEXs, DEXs Liquidity Pools, and Wallets all incur a gas fee. The amount of this gas fee will vary in cost depending on supply and demand. As currently designed: when demand on Ethereum or an ERC-20 network is at its highest, gas fees are at also their highest.</p>

<p>In Automated Market Makers (AMM) lending providers (LPs) contribute assets for liquidity to market participants. These AMM pools utilize a bonding curve, typically built on a constant function market marker formula. Asset prices are constantly changed by the AMM pool in response to trading activities by participants. This is an effort to ensure that LPs can receive the same amount of assets they deposited when they withdrawal.</p>
<p>However, due to the volatility of asset prices and arbitragers, LPs occasionally will not receive the exact amount of assets upon withdrawal. The dollar value of the assets they withdraw would typically be lower than if they had not provided liquidity and just held the assets. This dollar value shortfall is known as impermanent loss. The loss is said to be impermanent because if asset prices return to the level during withdrawal the loss is eliminated.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="roi">ROI<a href="#roi" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ROI" title="Direct link to ROI">​</a></h3>
<p>Return On Investment. The gains or losses on an investment. For example, doubling your investment in an asset would be a 100% gain, or 100% ROI. Losing all of your investment would be a 100% loss, or -100% ROI.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="slippage">Slippage<a href="#slippage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Slippage" title="Direct link to Slippage">​</a></h3>
<p>In trade, there is almost always a spread between the price that a buyer will pay and the price that a seller will sell an asset. When an order is made, this difference in price between buyer and seller expectations results in price slippage. This slippage in price is usually 1-3% but can be even more for coins with limited liquidity. This slippage can lead to a final sale price of the asset that is either more or less than the requested transaction amount.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="smart-contract">Smart Contract<a href="#smart-contract" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Smart Contract" title="Direct link to Smart Contract">​</a></h3>
<p>A digital contract that is programmed in a language that is considered Turing complete, meaning that with enough processing power and time, a properly programmed Smart Contract should be able to use its code base and logical algorithms to perform almost any digital task or process. Ethereum&#x27;s programming languages, such as Solidity and Vyper, are Turing complete.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spread">Spread<a href="#spread" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spread" title="Direct link to Spread">​</a></h3>
<p>When an order is made on an exchange or market, the disagreement of the difference in price between potential buy and sell offers of an asset is called the spread. A wide spread in price can lead to higher slippage.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stablecoin">Stablecoin<a href="#stablecoin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stablecoin" title="Direct link to Stablecoin">​</a></h3>
<p>In cryptocurrency, it is a digital cryptocurrency equivalent to one (1) Dollar USD. In theory, the price of the stablecoin is pegged to the US Dollar, but in practice, there is some variance to nearly all stablecoins except for coins like DAI, which are designed with no volatility.</p>
<p>A stablecoin is an attractive investment to investors because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be used as a safe harbor or hedge for cryptocurrency funds in times of downward volatility, also known as a bear market, whether this trend in downward volatility is temporary or prolonged in duration.</li>
<li>It can be used as diversification into the realm of Cryptocurrency finance to take advantage of new products in CeFi and DeFi that are unavailable elsewhere, as a safe diversification into crypto that won&#x27;t lose nor gain significant value to the stablecoin price.</li>
<li>A coin with a stable price is used for transferring crypto around, as a means to not lose value in the base asset itself as it&#x27;s being moved around or deployed to Smart Contracts or wallets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stake">Stake<a href="#stake" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stake" title="Direct link to Stake">​</a></h3>
<p>The act of depositing a cryptocurrency coin or token into a yield farming project and/or protocol, whether the access to the project is either through CeFi or DeFi methods.</p>
<p>Stakers hope to gain interest on their deposits into these yield farming projects and offerings. CeFi is considered safer for several reasons - including strict rules, permitting, and regulations. However, DeFi tends to give much high rewards, while being accompanied with much higher risks, the earlier the investor participates in the project&#x27;s lifecycle, testing, and development.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="staking">Staking<a href="#staking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Staking" title="Direct link to Staking">​</a></h3>
<p>The act of staking a cryptocurrency deposit to yield farm additional cryptocurrency via CeFi or DeFi staking offerings, programs, or projects.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="testnet">Testnet<a href="#testnet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Testnet" title="Direct link to Testnet">​</a></h3>
<p>A testing network for a new coin, project, or product, or for potential improvements to an existing product or offering. Testnets are used to test the viability and vulnerability of new ideas, concepts, code, and processes prior to moving on to a production network or networks of some sort.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="token">Token<a href="#token" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Token" title="Direct link to Token">​</a></h3>
<p>A type of coin, except with much greater functionality. Tokens can also be used as a method of payment like coins, but unlike coins, they can excel at other use cases such as the democratic governance of a protocol or system, or as a means to use underlying coins to make liquidity tokens from these coin deposits.</p>
<p>These liquidity tokens could then be used in innovative new strategies elsewhere via delegated funds to amplify gains with little risk to the underlying asset the liquidity token is based upon. An investor could choose this action so that further gains to their assets may be made by using the automated actions of intelligent Smart Contracts to optimize gains.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="turing-complete">Turing Complete<a href="#turing-complete" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Turing Complete" title="Direct link to Turing Complete">​</a></h3>
<p>In programming, it refers to a language that is powerful and semi-autonomous, in a way. When a language such as Solidity or Vyper is Turing complete, it means that with enough processing power and time, a properly programmed Smart Contract using a Turing complete language should be able to use its code base and logical algorithms to perform nearly any digital task or process.</p>
<p>A Turing complete language can even be programmed to have impacts on real-world activities through electronic means, as these rapidly executed digital commands can trigger actions in the real world through sensors, relays, switches, cameras, alarms, and alerts that can trigger a human and/or automatic response.</p>
<p>The concept of a Turing complete programming language was named after the inventor of the idea, Alan Turing. He was an unsung war hero and legendary mathematician. Turing was also a renowned and brilliant computer scientist, cryptanalyst, and forward thinker.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tvl">TVL<a href="#tvl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to TVL" title="Direct link to TVL">​</a></h3>
<p>The Total Value Locked into a Smart Contract or set of Smart Contracts that may be deployed or stored at one or more exchanges or markets. This is used as a measurement of investor deposits. It is the dollar value of all the coins or tokens locked into a platform, protocol, lending program, yield farming program, or insurance liquidity pool.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="volatility">Volatility<a href="#volatility" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Volatility" title="Direct link to Volatility">​</a></h3>
<p>In investing, a measure of how rapid changes are seen to the price of an asset or market. Newer early-stage technology companies and projects in the explosive growth stage tend to see very high volatility in the price of their assets in their early days. Should the company or project behind the volatile asset see their venture survive over time, this volatility tends to be much reduced as the company&#x27;s market cap grows and matures.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wallet">Wallet<a href="#wallet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wallet" title="Direct link to Wallet">​</a></h3>
<p>A software or hardware cryptocurrency wallet that can hold a variety of coins.</p>
<p>Wallets may also be considered a cold wallet - meant to be used for long term storage of crypto coins for security purposes or a hot wallet, which is considered more at risk than a cold wallet due to its inaccessibility (usually offline). A hot wallet is meant to be used for active or semi-active transactions in and out of that wallet, as well as a place to withdraw or add funds.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whale">Whale<a href="#whale" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Whale" title="Direct link to Whale">​</a></h3>
<p>A person who HODLs a large amount of cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="yearn-finance">Yearn Finance<a href="#yearn-finance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Yearn Finance" title="Direct link to Yearn Finance">​</a></h3>
<p>A suite of DeFi tools and products in an interconnected financial ecosystem running on various smart contracts. The yEarn Finance ecosystem is community-controlled and governed via a governance token called YFI.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="yfi">YFI<a href="#yfi" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to YFI" title="Direct link to YFI">​</a></h3>
<p>The governance token for the yEarn Finance ecosystem and suite of tools. YFI holders can submit, discuss, and vote upon various YIPs to make operational or governance changes to the ecosystem and its products. YFI was the first Fair Launch token, meaning that there was no Founder, Venture Capitalist, or early investor pre-mining program to privately claim a portion of a coin&#x27;s supply. YFI was Fair Launched on July 20, 2020, with an initial limited supply of only 30,000 tokens and an initial price of $34.53, according to Coingecko.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="yield-farming">Yield Farming<a href="#yield-farming" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Yield Farming" title="Direct link to Yield Farming">​</a></h3>
<p>The manual or automatic lending and/or arbitrage of digital assets to provide an ROI for lending out or depositing digital assets in CeFi or DeFi. Yield Farming can provide an additional income stream over and above any potential increase in the value of an underlying asset. For several reasons - including the ability to make rapid changes, much lower overhead costs, and no regulatory costs - DeFi tends to provide much higher yields when compared to CeFi options.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="yip">YIP<a href="#yip" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to YIP" title="Direct link to YIP">​</a></h3>
<p>Yearn Improvement Protocol (YIP). Potential YIPs are collaboratively generated by the yEarn Finance community, and are discussed, rejected, or improved upon by YFI token holders and community members providing feedback and suggestions. YIPs are submitted using a certain approved format and method.</p>
<p>Under current governance rules, a quorum of 20% of deposited governance tokens is required to vote on a YIP for it to be considered a valid vote. To pass: a vote on a YIP must have a majority vote of 50%+ of deposited governance tokens voting in favor of the YIP for a YIP to be passed. This democratically community approved YIP is then implemented by multisignature wallet signers in charge of the Smart Contracts behind yEarn Finance</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="yinsure">yInsure<a href="#yinsure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to yInsure" title="Direct link to yInsure">​</a></h3>
<p>A new type of insurance was invented by YFI Developer Andre Cronje for crypto-assets and crypto derivatives with underwriting provided by Nexus Mutual. It is a prototype for a new type of tokenized insurance. yInsure tokens are liquidity tokens of various types that allow investors to provide liquidity for crypto insurance pools.</p>
<p>Investors who choose to be Liquidity Providers (LPs) of crypto insurance services are rewarded with a share of initiation fees and weekly fees of customers who have sought the cover or hedge against thefts or hacks of insured digital assets that are offered by yInsure.</p>
<p>Andre explains an innovative aspect of this prototype crypto-insurance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The design of this system allows any asset that has a financial primitive to be insured, be it a base asset such as DAI, or a composite asset such as aDAI or yDAI.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="yliquidate">yLiquidate<a href="#yliquidate" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to yLiquidate" title="Direct link to yLiquidate">​</a></h3>
<p>A set of automated liquidation Smart Contracts for Aave that requires zero capital. It is currently being developed in a Testnet.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="yswap">ySwap<a href="#yswap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ySwap" title="Direct link to ySwap">​</a></h3>
<p>A Single-sided Automated Market Maker (AMM) that is in production but at a Beta stage of its development.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ytoken">yToken<a href="#ytoken" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to yToken" title="Direct link to yToken">​</a></h3>
<p>A cryptocurrency derivative asset class invented by Developer Andre Cronje, a yToken represents a liquidity token that is given in exchange to an investor&#x27;s deposit(s). yTokens are used in Yearn Finance products for a variety of uses including lending, insurance liquidity (yInsure), and automated optimized yield farming (yVault).</p>
<p>Examples of yTokens include yCRV, yYFI, and yaLINK. These are primary or secondary crypto derivatives of base crypto assets CRV, YFI and the primary crypto derivative aLINK provided by Aave.</p>
<p>This cryptocurrency derivative asset may also be a <em>second</em> cryptocurrency derivative running a Smart Contract atop another cryptocurrency derivative such as aDAI, an Aave USD liquidity token on Aave.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="yvault">yVault<a href="#yvault" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to yVault" title="Direct link to yVault">​</a></h3>
<p>A programmatically adjusted lending aggregator, arbitrageur, and optimized yield farmer. Yearn smart contracts are considered simpler and lower risk than their yVault counterparts. In comparison, yVault smart contracts are considered more complex and higher risk, but in return tend to yield higher ROI.</p>
<p>An example of a complex strategy that can be accomplished by a yVault using a Turing complete program and Smart Contract is the yETH strategy, described as:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Lending - Where assets are lent out via lenders such as Aave, Compound, and dYdX.</li>
<li>Trading - Assets provided to Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve earn trading fees.</li>
<li>Liquidity incentives - Protocols and markets such as Compound, Balancer, and Curve provide liquidity incentives.</li>
</ol>
<p>By applying the voting power of governance tokens, the power of delegated funds are used to vote for additional incentive rewards for providing liquidity, which can sometimes be reward multipliers for volume users. These multipliers can greatly enhance the ROI of deposited funds.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="zapper">Zapper<a href="#zapper" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Zapper" title="Direct link to Zapper">​</a></h3>
