# Interface Guide

DeFi can look complicated, but like any new technology, the best way to get comfortable with it… is to use it. This short guide will take you through the steps to start earning that sweet sweet yield with yCRV. Are you ready anon? Let’s go.

You'll need a browser [wallet](https://finematics.com/top-3-defi-wallets-for-2021/) and some [ETH](https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/how-to-use-the-browser-buy-eth-and-send-transactions-on-metamask-mobile/) in it to pay for gas fees. You'll also need some CRV in your wallet which can be bought at your favorite exchange like CowSwap, Uniswap, Binance, FTX.

## How to zap from CRV or yCRV to any of the 3 types of reward tokens

As yCRV is the base-token and carries no native yield or voting power, you'll likely want to position yourself into one of the three activated-tokens.

1) Go to [yCRV interface](http://y.finance/) and decide which token you want to zap to. You can zap from either CRV or yCRV:
    - [**st-yCRV (Staking Rewards):**](#staked-ycrv) [yVault](https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-finance-explained-what-are-vaults-and-strategies-96970560432) that receives admin fees and bribes from locked CRV.
    - [**lp-yCRV (Liquidity Pool Rewards):**](#lpd-ycrvcrv) yVault for CRV/yCRV LP tokens, autocompounds emissions and fees.
    - [**vl-yCRV (Curve Gauges Voting Power):**](#voting-with-ycrv) Vote power mechanism to vote on Curve gauge weights.
