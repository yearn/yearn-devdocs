## Support

#### I deposited into a vault, but the vault token isn't showing in my wallet? How do I make it appear?

- On the [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance) user interface, click the name of the vault that you deposited in. This will take you to to the Etherscan page for the vault. Click on the "Tracker" link in the "More Info" box to find the vault token page. Copy the address from there and follow your wallet's instructions on [adding a custom token](https://docs.yearn.finance/getting-started/guides/how-to-add-a-custom-token-to-metamask)
- Alternatively, most vault tokens are supported on [Zapper.fi](https://zapper.fi) shortly after their release.

#### I'm getting an error that says "SafeERC20: low-level call failed". How do I resolve this?

- This most often occurs when submitting a duplicate transaction. If you want to deposit $100 into a vault, you can submit that deposit as many times you want until one of those transactions is executed. Afterwards, the rest will show this error because you no longer have that $100 in your wallet.

#### I'm getting an error that says "ALERT: Transaction Error. Exception thrown in contract code." What does that mean?

- There may be a bug in the contract that you are interacting with. bring this up with the team of [Discord](https://discord.gg/yearn).

#### I paid gas for a deposit, but it didn't go through, why is that?

- You pay gas even if a transaction fails. This can happen if the price of gas increased shortly after the transaction was submitted

#### I'm having issues with yearn.fi

- This website is one of many front-ends maintained by separate groups of developers. Consider getting in touch with the yearn.fi development team via their website or through social media channels.

**If you have any other questions about using the protocol, it's best to ask in either [Discord](https://discord.gg/yearn) or [Telegram](https://t.me/yearnfinance)**
