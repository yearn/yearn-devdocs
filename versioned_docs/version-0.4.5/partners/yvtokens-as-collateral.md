# yvToken as collateral

## Why use yvTokens as collateral?

### They’re yield generating

A Yearn Vault token is a yield-bearing version of a token, so when locked up as collateral it will still generate yield. A single vault token can run up to 20 yield-generating strategies. All Vaults at [yearn.finance main website](https://yearn.finance/#/vaults) run "uponly" strategies.

### The safest yields in DeFi

Vaults strategies are constantly audited to practice the highest security standards of DeFi. Grow with us one day at a time. More information at:

* [Vaults & Strategies Deployment Security Guidelines](https://docs.yearn.finance/developers/v2/DEPLOYMENT)
* [Yearning for Yearn: Messari Report](https://messari.io/article/yearning-for-yearn)
* [Yearn Security Processes](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/blob/master/SECURITY.md)

### Split fees with Yearn

Yearn's fee-sharing partner [program](https://docs.yearn.finance/partners/introduction) allows you to earn up to 50% of the fees generated on your users' TVL every month. We are in this together.

### They’re ERC20 compatible

yvTokens are [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) compatible (like any other commonly expected token), there is no code security overhead for developers to implement any yvToken as a new option for collateral

### They’re almost 100% liquid

Strategies that lock tokens are kept to an absolute minimum amount of time. To learn more about strategy and fund allocation visit [yearn.watch](https://yearn.watch/) for a look into what's going on right now.

### They’re transparent
